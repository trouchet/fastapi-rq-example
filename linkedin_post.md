If you’ve ever tried background jobs in Python, you know it can get messy—too many libraries, tricky scaling, and lots of moving parts. Queues are essential, but the ecosystem often overcomplicates things. ⚙️

So I built a clean solution:
- 🚀 FastAPI backend for submitting and tracking jobs (easy to extend).
- 🟢 RQ + Redis for reliable, distributed processing.
- 📊 Endpoints for job status, results, and history.
- 🐳 Docker Compose for simple orchestration and a live RQ dashboard.

What’s cool: this stack comes from the same developers behind Pydantic and Conda, so it’s built on proven, modern Python tools. 🐍

Key takeaways:
- 🔄 Async APIs need clear feedback.
- 🎨 Good client UX (progress bars, color, clear errors) makes a huge difference.
- 🧩 Python can be simple and scalable with the right tools.
